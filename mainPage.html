                  <p>Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges.[3] Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately. It currently offers 18 agents to choose from. They are Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Cypher, Sova, Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach, Reyna, Killjoy, Skye, Yoru, Astra, KAY/O, Chamber, and Neon.</p>
                  <h3 id="Unrated">Unrated</h3>
                  <p>In the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must deliver and activate the Spike on one of the multiple specified locations (bomb sites). If the attacking team successfully protects the activated Spike for 45 seconds it detonates, destroying everything in a specific area, and they receive a point.[3] If the defending team can deactivate the spike, or the 100-second round timer expires without the attacking team activating the spike, the defending team receives a point. If all the members of a team are eliminated before the spike is activated, or if all members of the defending team are eliminated after the spike is activated, the opposing team earns a point.[3] If both teams win 12 rounds, sudden death occurs, in which the winning team of that round wins the match, differing from overtime for competitive matches. Additionally, if after 4 rounds, a team wishes to forfeit that match, they may request a vote to surrender. If the vote is unanimous, the winning team gets all the victory credit for every round needed to bring them to 13, with the forfeiting team receiving losing credit.[11] A team gets only two chances to surrender: one as the attackers and the other as the defenders.</p>
                  <h3 id="SpikeRush">Spike Rush</h3>
                  <p>In the Spike Rush mode, the match is played as best of 7 rounds - the first team to win 4 rounds wins the match. Players begin the round with all abilities fully charged except their ultimate, which charges twice as fast as in standard games. All players on the attacking team carry a spike, but only one spike may be activated per round. Guns are randomized in every round and every player begins with the same gun. Ultimate point orbs in the standard game are present, but there are multiple power-up orbs instead. lore</p>
                  <h3 id="Competitive">Competitive</h3>
                  <p>Competitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the addition of a win-based ranking system that assigns a rank to each player after 5 games are played. Players are required to win at least 10 unrated matches before being able to play competitive matches.[13] In July 2020, Riot introduced a "win by two" condition for competitive matches, where instead of playing a single sudden death round at 12-12, teams will alternate playing rounds on attack and defense in overtime until a team claims victory by securing a two-match lead. Each overtime round gives players the same amount of money to purchase guns and abilities, as well as approximately half of their ultimate ability charge. After each group of two rounds, players may vote to end the game in a draw, requiring 6 players after the first set, 3 after the second, and thereafter only 1 player to agree to a draw. The competitive ranking system ranges from Iron to Radiant. Every rank except for Radiant has 3 tiers.[14] Immortal & Radiant are reserved for top 500 players in which there is a number associated to their rank allowing players in the top 500 to have a metric in which they can compare how they rank up to others at their level.</p>
                  <h3 id="Deathmatch">Deathmatch</h3>
                  <p>The Deathmatch mode was introduced on August 5, 2020.[16] 14 players enter a 9-minute free-for-all match and the first person to reach 40 kills or the player who has the most kills when time is up wins the match. Players spawn in with a random agent, and all abilities are disabled during the match which indulges pure gunplay. Green health packs drop on every kill, which set the player at maximum health, armor, and ammunition, unless the player is using a machine gun, which only gives the player an additional 30 bullets</p>

                  <h2 id="Agents">Agents</h2>
                  <hr>
                  <p>There are a large variety of playable agents available in the game. Agents are divided into 4 roles: Duelists, Sentinels, Initiators, and Controllers. Each agent has a different role which indicates how the agent is usually played.</p>
                  <h3 id="Duelist">Duelist</h3>
                  <p>Duelists specialize in attacking and entering a bomb site for the team. Riot's official definition for duelists is "self-sufficient fraggers."[24] Duelists mainly create space for their team while entering onto a site, giving their teammates information, and making entering a site easier. Their abilities tend to consist of flashes which blind enemies, and movement-based abilities that allow for them to cover large distances faster than other agents. This type of ability kit allows for duelists to shine best when they are able to catch players off guard and get impact frags.

                        On attack, duelists are most often expected to play forward, leading the attack. They are expected to be in front of everyone to get opening picks on enemies since their abilities often give them a competitive advantage when gunfighting an enemy.
                        
                        On defense, duelists will be holding choke points where enemies try to enter sites. Due to the mobility in their kits, they are able to get a pick and reposition, giving their team a numbers advantage.
                        
                        Duelists include Jett, Phoenix, Raze, Reyna, Yoru, and Neon.</p>
                  <h3 id="Sentinels">Sentinels</h3>
                  <p>Sentinels are the defensive line, which specializes in locking down sites and protecting teammates from enemies. Their abilities mainly consist of static 'objects' that are obstacles to the enemies. These objects can give the team valuable information and/or deal damage.

                        On attack, sentinels can use their abilities to cut off certain parts of the map or set up 'objects' that can ensure the enemy cannot flank without being noticed.
                        
                        On defense, sentinels can use their abilities to slow enemies from entering a site. This provides valuable time for the sentinels' team members to come and provide defensive support.
                        
                        Sentinels include Chamber, Cypher, Killjoy, and Sage.</p>
                  <h3 id="Controller">Controller</h3>
                  <p>Controllers specialize in "slicing up dangerous territory to set their team up for success."[24] They use their abilities to create coverage or clear out areas of space with crowd control.

                        To help their team enter into enemy territory, their abilities can consist of smokes, slows, stuns, and flashes. With their smokes, controllers can control sightlines on the map, making it safer to move through the map without getting seen.
                        
                        On offense, controllers can smoke off certain sightlines and use their crowd control on common defensive spots to force enemies into the open.
                        
                        On defense, controllers can smoke and/or use crowd control on entryways to delay or discourage the enemy team from moving forward.
                        
                        Controllers include Astra, Brimstone, Omen, and Viper.</p>
                  <h3 id="Initiators">Initiators</h3>
                  <p>Initiators plan out the offensive pushes. Initiators specialize in breaking through defensive enemy positions. Initiators' abilities can consist of flashes but also abilities that can reveal the location of enemies. This information allows for attackers to know where enemies are and make taking a site easier.

                        On defense, initiators can use their abilities to help their teammates retake a lost site.
                        
                        Initiators include Breach, KAY/O, Skye, and Sova.</p>

                  <p>Valorant, like many other competitive shooters, has become active within esports. Riot Games decided to create the first tournament called "First Strike" to establish a foundation for an esports scene to be created with the game.[58] In November 2020, Riot Games announced the tournament series called VALORANT Champions Tour (VCT) which is a year-long competition consisting of three levels:

                        VALORANT Challengers - regional competitions which are qualifiers for Masters
                        VALORANT Masters - international competitions in mid-season, divided into many stages
                        VALORANT Champions - the world championship of the year
                        Teams will qualify directly for Champions by winning VALORANT Masters Stage 3 or via top places in Circuit Point Standings of their region, based on results of Challengers and Masters. Teams who are at middle places in Circuit Point Standings will have one more chance to qualify for Champions by winning the Last Chance Qualifiers (North America, EMEA, South America, Asia Pacific).
                        
                        The 2021 VALORANT Champions was hosted in 1–12 December at Berlin.[59][60] Acend defeated Gambit Esports on the score 3–2 in finals and became the first ever world champion of Valorant esports.
